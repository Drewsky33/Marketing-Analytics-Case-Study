# Data Analysis

## Approaching the problem
To have an idea about how to tackle this business problem, we need to visualize what kind of output we want and then slowly work backwards. Essentially, we need to observe what kind of SQL outputs will allow us to match the requirements from the marketing team. 

### Defining the target state
The end-goal of this project will be a SQL script that will allow us to generate a completed email template for each unique customer. Our main goal is to help them populate their emails with the correct and necessary data.
