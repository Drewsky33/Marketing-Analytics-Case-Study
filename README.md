# Marketing-Analytics-Case-Study

This project is from Danny Ma's Serious SQL course. 

## Scenario
The marketing team has shared a draft of e-mails they wish to send to customers. Creating personalized customer emails is a staple of a lot of digital companies. We have been asked to support the customer analytics team at DVD Rental Co who want us to gather data points required to popular of their first email marketing campaign. 

I'll be using SQL to solve these problems and capture the data needed to ensure a smooth marketing campaign.
